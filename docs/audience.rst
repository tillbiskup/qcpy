Target audience
===============

Who is the target audience of the qcPy package? Is it interesting for me?


Quantum chemists aiming at reproducibility
==========================================

The qcPy package addresses every scientist working in the field of quantum-chemical calculations (mainly DFT) on a daily base.


Motivation and general ideas
============================

The motivation an general idea behind the qcPy package is to ensure reproducibility and replicability when handling quantum-chemical calculations and the post-processing of the acquired data, using the `ASpecD framework <https://www.aspecd.de/>`_.
